I'm <strong>Jonatas</strong>, a lawyer and a programmer passionate about productivity hacks. I spent a decade working with CyberSecurity and CyberCrimes, but in 2016 I learned the Dart language, then Flutter, and today I am passionate about everything related to that language. Before that I worked with <strong>backend development</strong> (javascript and php), <strong>frontend development</strong> (bootstrap, react, angular), and <strong>mobile development</strong> (native android with java and kotlin, native ios with swift and objc, xamarin, and react native).
 
I am the creator of <strong>GetX</strong>, a mobile/frontend framework capable of accelerating mobile, web and desktop development, which uses Flutter as a base, and of <strong>GetServer</strong>, a backend framework based on the same syntax, as well as authoring some multiplatform native solutions for the Flutter, like <strong>VideoCompress</strong>. I'm passionate about <strong>productivity hacks</strong>, and I try to make other developers' lives more productive.

I have worked for the last few years with consultancy: <strong>legal</strong>, generally related to privacy policies, terms of use, data protection laws, or <strong>technical</strong> related to backend/frontend projects, related to structure, organization security, and I'm currently VP of Engineer Mobile at Iris
